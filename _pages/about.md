Hi, I'm Yutian Zhang (张雨田), a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm a member of [Human-Data Interaction group](https://hdi.cs.umd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Leo Zhicheng Liu](https://www.zcliu.org/). Before joining UMD, I received my M.S. degree from Sun Yat-Sen University, where my research primarily focuses on visual analytics and urban visualization.
